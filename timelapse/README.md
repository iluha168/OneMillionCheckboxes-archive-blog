Download [one million checkboxes data](https://archive.org/details/one-million-checkboxes-data) and unpack it into folder called "data" before running any scripts in this directory.

Scripts in this folder were used to create [binary one million checkboxes data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YjzpiEjltycdp9HYeabKqVXmsl28a7Be) and [some timelapse videos on my channel](https://youtu.be/qlU-l3JKObA), **obviously after the event has ended**.
