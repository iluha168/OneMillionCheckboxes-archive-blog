# What is this?
I have decided to publish all of the code I have written during (and some right after) [the one million checkboxes event](https://onemillioncheckboxes.com)
(later "OMCB"). It is a silly project by [Nolen Royalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Checkboxes#Development)
(his [blog about OMCB]( https://eieio.games/blog/one-million-checkboxes)).

I have stumbled upon OMCB in [this video by nolen](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CYBh5FwdwLg)
the day it was released. I, and a significant amount of people, have immediately started reverse-engineering
the website and have had a lot of fun toying with it since.

# Contents
- [My API implementation](/api/README.md).
- [Private discord bot](/discord_bot/README.md).
- [Timelapse generator](/timelapse/README.md) made after the event.

The code in this repository was made quick in order to release new *funny features âœ¨* ASAP
and with no intent of ever publishing it. I will not be responsible for any mental injuries encountered while reading it. You have been warned.

## License
MIT. You may do anything with this repository as long as you retain credits.

## Dependencies
You might need to install [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org) and [`deno` (latest working: v2.2.2)](https://deno.com/)
before running something in this repository.

# What's next?
Is the event actually over? Sadly, yes.
But there are many parodies of it online: 1 checkbox, 10 checkboxes, 1000 checkboxes, you name it,
most notably [OBCB - one billion checkboxes](https://checkbox.ing/), that is still online and probably has bots running.
I also made an [API wrapper for OBCB](https://github.com/iluha168/obcb-api-wrapper).

Both Nolen and I are still active and may publish silly useless projects for nothing but fun.
