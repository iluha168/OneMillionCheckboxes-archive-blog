My made-in-a-hurry implementation of a browserless client for https://onemillioncheckboxes.com, made during the first day of the site being live.

In addition to all browser features (heartbeat, toggling, live updates), this wrapper can render images from checkboxes, using different approaches for converting checkboxes into pixels.
