This directory contains source code of the bot used in a private discord server, originally redirected to by https://catgirls.win/omcb (more about that link: [eieio's youtube video](https://youtu.be/OI4DbECnp8A?t=218)).

The bot was used by server members to:
- instantly retrieve images of the entire checkbox field;
- record timelapses of one's projects appearing on the field;
- generate timelapses of previous events (e.g. unannounced bot attack by someone outside the discord server)
